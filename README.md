# Agnethon-EventTracker
firstly we made three databases for this web that is in hacki models.py that are committee,student,event databases
we have done frontend in react that is hackathon/client folder.
by running this two commmands
npm i
npm run dev
you can see our frontend
backend in django 
you have to install python after
pip install django 
you have to install some modules
rest_framework
i will mention in requirement.txt
cd hacka
python manage.py runserver
in these we have created some apis
we have used django rest framework this provides restful api work 
we forget to attend the mentor session becoause we cannot join the discord. this is our major fault.
Thank you!!!
